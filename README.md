# Bitcoin Price Prediction Using N-BEATS

This is a replication study of the research paper "**Bitcoin Price Prediction Using N-BEATS ML Technique**" published in *EAI Endorsed Transactions on Scalable Information Systemsby* by G. Asmat and K. M. Maiyama. The project evaluates the efficacy of the Neural Basis Expansion Analysis Time Series (N-BEATS) architecture in forecasting Bitcoin prices, specifically focusing on its ability to handle the extreme volatility, nonlinearity and stochasity of cryptocurrency markets.

## Project Overview
Cryptocurrency markets are characterized by high-frequency fluctuations and non-linear dependencies. This project demonstrates how the N-BEATS deep learning architecture provides a robust prediction by decomposing time series into interpretable trend and seasonality components comparing to traditional models such as Linear Regression and Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) network.

## Key Features
- **Data:** Most recent 729 days of hourly Bitcoin price data, sourced from Yahoo Finance.
- **Pre-processing:**
  - Implementation of Min-Max scaling to normalize features (Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, Volume).
  - Data reshaping into 3D structures for compatibility with deep learning layers.
- **Model:** The N-BEATS model utilizes a series of stacks and blocks to perform "backcasting" and "forecasting," allowing the network to identify complex temporal patterns without manual feature engineering.
- **Prediction:** Application of a 3-hour look-back window to predict the subsequent hour's High and Low prices.
- **Evaluation:**
  -  **R-squared ($R^2$)**: indicating the percentage of variation in a dependent variable that is explained by an independent variable(s) in a regression model. It's Ranging from 0 to 1 (0% to 100%), it represents how well a model fits the data, with 1 indicating a perfect fit.
  -  **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: a foundational regression model metric that measures the average magnitude of errors between predicted and actual values.It's calculated as the average of the absolute differences, lower MAE scores (0 is ideal) indicate better performance:

$$MAE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n |y_i - \hat{y}_i|$$

  -  **Performance Comparison**:

<div align="center">

   | Model | $R^2$ score | Mean Absolute Error (MAE) |
   |     :---:      |     :---:      |     :---:      |
   | N-BEATS         | 0.998924      | 0.00220156367       |
   | Linear Regression         | 0.9645      | 0.008994       |
   | LSTM network      | 0.9263      | 0.04753       |

  - **Interpretability:** Decomposition of predictions into trend and seasonality blocks.
  - **Results:** The N-BEATS model demonstrated superior performance in capturing Bitcoin's volatile price movements compared to traditional and recurrent neural network baselines, particularlly, a robust trend capturing during high-volatility periods.

## N-BEATS Mathematical Formulation
The Neural Basis Expansion Analysis for Time Series (N-BEATS) is a deep learning architecture specifically engineered for time series forecasting without the need for domain-specific feature engineering. It is characterized by a hierarchical structure of blocks and stacks that utilize fully connected layers and residual connections to decompose data into interpretable signals like trend and seasonality.
### Block Operation
For each block $b$ with input $x_{b}$, the model computes a set of expansion coefficients ($\theta$) using fully connected layers:

$$\theta_{b}^{f} = FC_{b,f}(x_{b}) \quad \text{and} \quad \theta_{b}^{b} = FC_{b,b}(x_{b})$$

Where $FC$ represents the fully connected layers.
### Basis Expansion
The forecast ($\hat{y}_{a}$) and backcast ($\hat{y}_b$) are then generated by projecting these coefficients onto basis functions ($g$):

$$\hat{y}_{b} = \sum_{i=1}^{\text{dim}(\theta_{b}^{f})} \theta_{b,i}^{f} g_{i}^{f} \quad \text{and} \quad \hat{x}_{b} = \sum_{i=1}^{\text{dim}(\theta_{b}^{b})} \theta_{b,i}^{b} g_{i}^{b}$$

The basis functions $g$ can be generic (like a polynomial for trend) or learned through the network.
### Residual Hierarchy (Backcasting)
The input for the next block ($x_{b+1}$) is the residual of the previous backcast:

$$x_{b+1} = x_{b} - \hat{x}_{b}$$

This enables the "decomposition" mentioned in the paper, as each block subtracts what it has already "explained" from the input.
### Global Forecast
The final prediction ($\hat{y}$) is the sum of all individual block forecasts across the entire stack:

$$\hat{y} = \sum_{b} \hat{y}_{b}$$

This summation allows the model to combine short-term oscillations and long-term trends into a single, highly accurate Bitcoin price prediction.
